I got the solution to my question and i solved the problem.

Here's the step that, how i resolved the problem.

1) Created "WEB-INF/web.xml" in my angular src folder, the path is as follows

Your_Folder/src/WEB-INF/web.xml
2) In web.xml i added below lines,

<web-app> 
    <error-page> 
        <error-code>404</error-code> 
        <location>/index.html</location> 
    </error-page> 
</web-app>
3) Add external folder into angular.json so can while building application it will be available into dist folder,

In angular.json

"assets": [ "src/assets","src/favicon.ico","src/WEB-INF" ]
4) Build the application with below command,

ng build --prod --base-href=/myApp/
5) Rename the dist folder with base-href name

6) Copy the dist or base-href folder and paste into

apache-tomcat-8.5.37/webapps
7) Start the tomcat and your application will run, even after refresh the browser.
